Python Backtrace
----------------

Python backtrace is a prototype implementation of my solution to 
the need for a debugging tool that was discussed by Glenn Ramsey 
at the 21st July meeting of NZPUG.


This implementation uses Python's "with" statement and decorators 
to keep a track of every method's invocation and return values. 
In the event of an exception being raised, not only is the current 
stack open for inspection but also the stack + return values of 
the last few function returns.

Note: currently this is quite hacky, and uses global variables 
nastily because I am running late and needed to get it done.

I am not sure if it will be worth maintaining this, or better to just
start from scratch: this project was as much about learning how to 
write context managers and getting more experience with github as it
was about the stated problem.
